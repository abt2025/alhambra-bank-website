## Founder's Message

The decision to start Alhambra Bank was rooted in a fundamental belief that everyone deserves to be treated with dignity, respect, and fairness, regardless of their skin color, religion, sexual orientation, or any other defining trait. Traditional banking systems have often been criticized for perpetuating inequality, whether through discriminatory practices, restricted access for underserved groups, lack of access for marginalized communities, or biases in decision-making. Alhambra Bank was established to disrupt these conventions and forge a financial institution that genuinely serves everyone on equal terms.

Our mission is to create a secure, inclusive, and empowering environment where both individuals and businesses can flourish without the threat of discrimination or exclusion. We firmly believe that banking should serve as a means of empowerment rather than a hindrance. By extending respect to all and providing equitable access to financial services, we strive to cultivate trust, fortify communities, and advance a society that is more just and inclusive.

**Ali Alsari**
Non-Executive Board Director

> "Alhambra Bank is more than just a bankâ€”it's a movement toward a world where financial institutions reflect the values of fairness, equality, and respect for all. We are here to redefine what it means to be a bank, one that prioritizes people over profit and inclusion over exclusion."

Sincerely,
**Ali Alsari**
Non-Executive Board Director
